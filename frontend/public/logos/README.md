# Brand Logos

This directory contains brand logos for the application. 

## File Naming Convention
- Logo files should be named in lowercase
- Remove spaces and special characters
- Use PNG format for best compatibility
- Example: "Brand Name" â†’ "brandname.png"

## Fallback
If a logo file is not found, the system will automatically generate a colored avatar with the brand's initials.

## Adding New Logos
1. Create a PNG image (recommended size: 200x200px)
2. Name it according to the brand name in lowercase
3. Place it in this directory

## Existing Logos
- zoho-inventory.png - Zoho Inventory logo
- faire.png - Faire marketplace logo
- firebase.png - Firebase logo

Feel free to add more brand logos as needed!
