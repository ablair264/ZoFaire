# UI Enhancement Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. âœ… Dark/Light Mode Toggle
- Added background color to make it more visible
- Added tooltip to explain functionality
- Used themed colors for the icons (yellow for light mode, purple for dark mode)

### 2. âœ… Vertical Buttons
- Changed "Load All Items" and "Upload Selected" buttons to vertical layout
- Each button now displays:
  - Icon at the top
  - Text split across multiple lines
  - Maintains the same functionality

### 3. ðŸ”§ Lottie Animations Setup

To ensure Lottie animations work properly, please run these commands:

```bash
cd frontend

# Clean install to ensure lottie-react is properly installed
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Verify lottie-react is installed
npm list lottie-react
```

If you still don't see the animations:

1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Ensure the loader.json file is properly imported
3. Try clearing your browser cache

### 4. ðŸ“‹ Complete Setup Checklist

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Copy logo files to public directory:**
